Build a complete Fullstack Developer Portfolio. This is not a static site; it is a dynamic web application with a custom Content Management System (CMS), live API integrations, advanced UI animations, and a flawless architecture. 

The system must be production-ready, cleanly structured, and follow best practices. It must be beautifully designed and follow Senior-level standards.

### 1. Tech Stack
Choose the following modern, high-performance stack:
* Framework: Next.js 14+ (App Router)
* Language: TypeScript (Strict mode enabled)
* Database: PostgreSQL (Supabase or Vercel Postgres)
* ORM: Prisma or Drizzle ORM
* Styling: Tailwind CSS + UI components (Shadcn/UI or Aceternity UI)
* Animations: Framer Motion (for smooth page transitions and scroll reveals)
* State Management: Zustand (if needed) or React Context for themes
* Email System: Resend or Nodemailer
* Validation: Zod + React Hook Form
* Authentication: NextAuth.js (Auth.js) - strictly for the hidden Admin CMS.

The architecture must be modular, highly scalable, and SEO-optimized.

### 2. User Roles & Authentication
Implement a hidden authentication system:
* Public Viewer: Can browse the portfolio, interact with elements, and send contact messages.
* Admin (Owner): Secured route (/admin). Requires login (GitHub OAuth or Magic Link) to access the CMS to add/edit projects, update skills, and read messages.

### 3. Core System Requirements (Database Models)
The portfolio must be data-driven. Include the following models:
* Project: id, title, slug, description, content (Markdown/Rich Text), image_url, github_url, live_url, tech_stack (Array of strings), featured (boolean), created_at.
* Skill: id, name, category (Frontend, Backend, DevOps, Tools), icon_url, proficiency (1-100).
* Experience: id, company, role, start_date, end_date (nullable), description, achievements (Array of strings).
* Message (Contact): id, sender_name, sender_email, subject, message, read (boolean), created_at.

### 4. Dynamic Live Integrations
To show advanced backend skills, the portfolio must fetch real-time data:
* GitHub API: Fetch and display real-time contribution graph, total stars, and latest commits.
* Spotify API (Now Playing): A real-time widget showing the song currently playing or the last played track.
* WakaTime API (Optional): Display coding stats (languages used this week, total hours coded).

### 5. Interfaces: Public Side
The public portfolio must include:
* Header/Navbar: Must include a visible, elegant Language Toggle (PT-BR / EN) at the top of the page so users can easily switch the site's language.
* Hero Section: High-impact introduction, dynamic typing effect, and call-to-action.
* About & Experience Timeline: Chronological timeline fetching data from the Experience model.
* Bento Grid Layout for Skills: A modern, asymmetrical grid displaying skills, GitHub stats, and Spotify widget.
* Projects Gallery: Advanced filtering (by tech stack, category). Includes smooth layout animations when filtering.
* Project Detail Page (/projects/[slug]): Dynamic routing, Server-Side Rendered for SEO, reading full markdown content.
* Footer: Must include a clean, professional footer at the bottom stating "© 2026 Laura Hahn Schu. All rights reserved." (Keep it minimalist and authoritative, no emojis or hearts).

### 6. Interfaces: Admin CMS Side
A secure, private dashboard (/admin) to manage the portfolio without touching code:
* Overview Dashboard: Unread messages counter, total projects, and quick actions.
* Messages Kanban/List: View contact form submissions, mark as read/unread, delete.
* Content Editor: Forms to Add, EDIT (explicitly ensure there is an option to modify existing entries, pre-filling data to update them, not just add new ones), and Delete Projects, Skills, and Experiences.

### 7. Advanced UI/UX (The "Wow" Factor) & Theming
* Command Palette (Cmd+K / Ctrl+K): Implement a global search modal to navigate between pages, switch themes, or jump to specific projects instantly.
* Custom Cursor & Scroll Progress: Subtle UI enhancements that don't hurt performance.
* Loading States & Skeletons: Skeleton loaders for dynamic data (GitHub/Spotify/Projects) to avoid layout shifts.
* Aesthetic & Theme (Feminine & Badass): The design must break stereotypes, proving female developers build high-performance, authoritative software. 
    * To make these colors work perfectly with Dark/Light mode, YOU MUST USE CSS Variables in `globals.css` mapped to the `tailwind.config.ts`.
    * Light Mode: Use `#fff2fa` for the background.
    * Accents (Pinks): Use `#ff57ca` and `#de5097` for primary accents, active states, and buttons.
    * Contrasts (Teal/Aqua): Use `#69dbd7`, `#9aedec`, and `#3bccc7` for subtle details, badges, and hover effects.
    * Dark Mode: Seamless toggle with system preference detection. Use a dark graphite/almost black background where the pinks and teals create a vibrant, modern contrast (cyberpunk soft aesthetic). The vibe must be highly professional, modern, and striking.

### 8. Contact System & Notifications
* Contact Form: Client-side validation using Zod.
* Database Storage: Save incoming messages to the Message table.
* Email Forwarding: Trigger an API route that uses Resend to forward the message to the owner's personal email instantly.
* Toast Notifications: Show sleek success/error toast messages upon submission.

### 9. Code Quality, Architecture & SEO
* Clean folder structure (/app, /components, /lib, /server, /actions).
* Extensive use of React Server Components (RSC) and Server Actions for data mutations.
* Strict TypeScript interfaces for all data.
* Environment variables properly configured (.env.example).
* Flawless 100/100 Lighthouse score (Performance, Accessibility, SEO).
* Global Metadata & Favicon: Explicitly configure Next.js metadata in `layout.tsx` to override any default platform icons (like Replit's). Use this exact URL for the favicon/icon: `https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/512/11813/11813431.png`.

### 10. Internationalization (i18n) & Bonus Features
* Default Language: The portfolio MUST be initially built and fully populated in Portuguese (PT-BR). 
* i18n Architecture: Implement high-performance and easy internationalization (i18n) using a modern Next.js library to toggle between Portuguese and English.
* Terminal/CLI Easter Egg: A hidden route or component where users can type commands (e.g., whoami, ls projects) to interact with the portfolio via text.
* 3D Element: A simple, interactive React Three Fiber (Three.js) model in the Hero section (e.g., a floating geometric shape that follows mouse movement).
